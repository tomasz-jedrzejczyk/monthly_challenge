What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence is defined as the capability of an engineered system to acquire, process, and apply knowledge and skills.

What is AI Effect?
Describes how the definition of AI changes as technology advances.

Categorisation - AI types:
Narrow AI (Week AI)
Systems programmed for a specific task with limited context, such as spam filters, chatbots, or voice assistants.
General AI (Strong AI)
Hypothetical systems with human-like cognitive abilities across multiple domains.
Super AI
Conceptual systems that exceed human intelligence. The transition from General to Super AI is known as the Technological Singularity.

AI-Based vs Conventional Systems
Conventional Systems
Use imperative programming where humans write the code (if-then-else) to transform inputs into outputs, making the logic relatively easy to understand.
AI-Based Systems
Use Machine Learning (ML) to identify patterns in data to determine future reactions. This often makes the decision-making process less transparent to humans.

AI Technology Categories
Fuzzy Logic
A type of logic based on the concept of partial truth, where certainty factors range between 0 and 1, rather than being strictly binary
Search Algorithms
These systematically explore a subset of all possible states or structures until a specific goal state is reached.
Reasoning Technique
These technologies generate conclusions from available information using logical processes
-Rule engines: Set of rules that determines which specific actions should occur once certain conditions have been satisfied.
-Deductive classifiers: Classifier that is based on the application of inference and logic to input data.
-Case-based reasoning: Solving new problems based on similar past cases.
-Procedural reasoning: AI technology used for constructing real-time reasoning systems.
Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
Involving computational techniques that enable systems to learn from data or experience.
-Neural networks: Uses computational techniques to enable systems to learn from data or experience rather than following explicitly programmed imperative rules.
    *Deep Learning (DL): Specific category of machine learning that utilises Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are defined by having multiple hidden layers of neurons.
      Layers and Neurons: A neural network consists of nodes called neurons organised into three types of layers: 
        Input layer that receives data,
        Output layer that produces the final prediction, 
        Hidden layers in between
    *Perceptrons: The simplest form is the single-layer perceptron, which contains only one layer and one neuron.
    *Weights and Biases: Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, while each individual neuron has a bias. These are internal variables that change as the network learns.
    *Activation Values: A neuron's output, calculated by an activation function.
-Support Vector Machines (SVM).
-Decision trees and Random forests.
-Bayesian models (statistical models using probability).
-Clustering and Association algorithms.
-Linear and Logistic regression.
-Genetic algorithms
