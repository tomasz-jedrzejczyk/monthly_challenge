LM froms
Supervised Learning
This form of learning relies on the use of labeled data to create a model. During the training phase, the algorithm analyzes pairs of inputs and their corresponding output labels (e.g., an image of a dog labeled "dog") to infer the relationship between them
Classification: This is used when the output is a discrete or categorical class. The model groups inputs into predefined classes, such as performing face recognition or object detection
Regression: This is used when the output is a numeric and continuous variable,,. Examples include predicting a person's age or future stock prices,. The sources explicitly note that "regression" in ML is a statistical prediction method and is distinct from "regression testing" in software engineering
Unsupervised Learning
This form creates models using unlabeled data. Because there are no labels, the algorithm analyzes the input data to detect inherent patterns, structures, or commonalities without external guidance
Clustering: This involves identifying similarities to sort data points into groups (clusters) based on common characteristics. A typical use case cited is grouping customers for marketing purposes
Association: This identifies relationships, dependencies, or co-occurring items within the data. A common example is a product recommendation system analyzing shopping behavior (e.g., identifying that people who buy diapers also buy beer)
Reinforcement Learning
This method involves an intelligent agent learning from experience through iterative interaction with an environment. Reinforcement Learning does not use training data,. Instead, the agent learns through a process of trial and error, receiving rewards for correct decisions and punishment/penalties for incorrect ones
Selecting a Form of ML
• Is labeled data available? If yes, use Supervised Learning.
    ◦ If the output is a category (e.g., "Cat" or "Dog"), use Classification.
    ◦ If the output is a number (e.g., Price), use Regression.
• Is the data unlabeled? If yes, use Unsupervised Learning.
    ◦ If grouping similar data, use Clustering.
    ◦ If finding co-occurring items, use Association.
• Is there interaction with an environment? If the problem involves multiple states and decisions, use Reinforcement Learning.
